# Rosseta
The Experiemental code for Rosseta

As there is huge traffic for all our experiments (~70 GB) and the related privacy issues, we upload the partial traffic in Github that can still reproduce similar results by running the test on a small scale. Researchers can also contact us via the email address left in Github to download the whole pcap files after they sign the agreement on preventing data misusing and privacy leakage. 

Data for traffic augmentation: [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WXfdj6egfa593sgGWvoNHfULnWOvKeUY?usp=sharing)

If you have any problem, please contact us via <moonight_flicker@outlook.com>.

The partial application traffic in `test-app` is ready for verification.
