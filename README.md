# Rosetta


Rosetta aims to enable robust TLS encrypted traffic classification in diverse network environments with TCP-aware traffic augmentation.

Note:

- The code for training Rosetta is in `/TIE/TIE-code/`.

- The partial data for traffic augmentation is in `/TIE/TIE-data/`.

- The partial website traffic for evaluation is in `/test-data/test-web/`.

- The partial application traffic for evaluation is in `/test-data/test-app/`.

- The code of models (CNN, DF, FS-Net, LSTM, SDAE and Transformer) is shown in `/`

- The cleaned data for traffic augmentation and well-trained TIE: [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WXfdj6egfa593sgGWvoNHfULnWOvKeUY?usp=sharing). Researchers can contact us via <moonight_flicker@outlook.com> to download the entire pcap files after signing the agreement on preventing data misusing and privacy leakage.Â
