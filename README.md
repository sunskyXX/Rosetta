# Rosetta
The Experiemental code for Rosseta

As there is huge traffic for all our experiments (~70 GB) and the related privacy issues, we upload the partial traffic in Github that can still reproduce similar results by running the test on a small scale. Researchers can also contact us via <moonight_flicker@outlook.com> to download the whole pcap files after they sign the agreement on preventing data misusing and privacy leakage. 

Note:

- Total cleaned data for traffic augmentation and well-trained TIE: [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WXfdj6egfa593sgGWvoNHfULnWOvKeUY?usp=sharing).

- The code for training Rosetta is in `/TIE/TIE-code`.

- The partial data for traffic augmentation is in `/TIE/TIE-data`.

- The partial website traffic for evaluation is in `/test-data/test-web/`.

- The partial application traffic for evaluation is in `/test-data/test-app/`.

- The code of models (CNN, DF, FS-Net, LSTM, SDAE and Transformer) is shown in `/`
